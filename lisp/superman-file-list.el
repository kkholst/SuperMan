;;{{{ Description:
;; The aim is to create a facility which allows to interactively
;; find and work with files, which does not require repeated and
;; time-consuming calls of e.g., the lunix-command `find'.
;;
;; One of the best features is that the file-list-alist is automatically
;; updated when a new file is added to one of the listed directories.
;; 
;; An alist with entries of the form (filename . /path/to/filename)
;; enables the following features
;;
;; select and display files in a buffer. then operate on the files
;; file-list: sorting (by time, name, or size), move, delete, copy, grep, dired, ...
;;
;; Examples: M-x file-list-by-name RET *\.tex$ RET
;;           M-x file-list-by-size-below-directory RET ~/Mail/ RET 1000000 RET
;;
;;}}}
;;{{{ Usage:
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------
;; 
;; (require 'file-list)
